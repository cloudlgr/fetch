# Data Quality Assessment and Recommendations for Receipts, Items, Brands, and Users Datasets


I’ve been analyzing the receipts, items, brands, and users datasets to ensure their quality and readiness for production use. While conducting the analysis, I identified several areas that require attention to optimize the data and improve our operations. Here's a summary:

---

## Key Questions About the Data
1. **Receipts & Items**: Are `totalSpent` and item-level `finalPrice` expected to match consistently for each receipt, or do discounts or external factors (e.g., promotions) explain discrepancies?
2. **Brands**: What constitutes a "top brand," and why do some entries lack brand codes? Should `brandCode` be mandatory?
3. **Users**: Are duplicates in user records expected? What should be the resolution strategy for duplicate entries (e.g., merging)?
4. **Cross-Dataset Integration**: How do the datasets relate? Are there constraints or guidelines for linking receipts, items, brands, and users? currently , barcode` from brands table does not consistent with the barcode` in item table

## How We Identified Data Quality Issues
Through systematic ingestion and normalization, I found:
1. **Incomplete or Missing Values**:
   - Fields like `needsFetchReviewReason`, `userFlaggedDescription`, and `brandCode` are inconsistently populated, leading to gaps.
   - Some key fields like `barcode` and `description` are missing for certain items.

2. **Data Type Inconsistencies**:
   - Numeric values like `pointsEarned` and `finalPrice` are stored as strings.
   - Boolean fields like `needsFetchReview` and `preventTargetGapPoints` show mixed data types (e.g., `1/0` vs `true/false`).

3. **Logical Discrepancies**:
   - `totalSpent` in receipts doesn’t always match the sum of item-level `finalPrice`, which raises questions about its calculation or the data ingestion process.
   - Date relationships (e.g., `purchaseDate` vs `createDate`) suggest potential inconsistencies.

## What We Need to Resolve These Issues
- **Domain Knowledge**: Insights into the intended structure and rules for key fields, such as:
  - Expected consistency for monetary fields (`totalSpent` vs `finalPrice`).
  - Mandatory or optional fields (e.g., `brandCode`, `userFlaggedNewItem`).
- **Business Logic**: Clear definitions for handling duplicates (users).

## Additional Information Needed for Optimization
1. **End Use Cases**:
   - What analytical questions or reports are we aiming to generate from these datasets? (e.g., spending patterns, brand performance)
   - Are there business KPIs tied to any of these datasets?
2. **Relationships Across Datasets**:
   - What is the intended linking strategy (e.g., `userId` in receipts vs users, `barcode` in items vs brands)?
3. **Data Ownership and Sources**:
   - What processes populate these datasets? Are there upstream sources where validations can be enforced?

## Performance and Scaling Concerns
1. **Volume of Data**: As the dataset grows, ensuring efficient joins between tables (receipts, items, users, brands) may impact query performance.
2. **Validation & Cleaning**:
   - Pre-ingestion validation rules (e.g., numeric fields, date relationships) are critical to avoid downstream issues.
3. **Production Scaling**:
   - Indexing fields like `receipt_id`, `userId`, and `barcode` will be crucial to support fast lookups and aggregations.
4. **Redundancy**:
   - Normalizing the structure into relational tables (e.g., separating receipts and items) will reduce data duplication and improve scalability.

## Next Steps
1. Confirm the business rules and relationships between datasets (e.g., `totalSpent` logic, brand code requirements).
2. Apply consistent data-cleaning rules for missing values, types, and duplicates.
3. Set up validation rules during ingestion to enforce consistency.
4. Optimize queries and indexes for high performance as datasets grow.

Let me know if you’d like me to provide further details or schedule a meeting to discuss the findings!
